The following tables provide the maximum number for a particular object or resource that
 a single Prisma AIRS NGFW and VM-Series firewall deployment can create, store, manage,
 or interact with based on allocated memory or tier. These limits apply to Prisma AIRS
 NGFW and VM-Series firewalls using licenses funded with Software NGFW credits.

For memory scaling, increments of memory are grouped into four tiers that represent the
 configuration capacity of the Prisma AIRS NGFW and VM-Series firewall. Regardless of the
 amount of memory you assign to a Prisma AIRS NGFW and VM-Series firewall instance, the
 tier that amount of memory falls into determines the limit for non-sessions values, such
 as security rules, address objects, security profiles, etc.

The memory profile and the total number of vCPUs determine how many cores are
 automatically assigned to the management plane and the dataplane. Additionally, you have
 the option to [customize the distribution of the dataplane
                cores](/content/techdocs/en_US/vm-series/11-1/vm-series-deployment/license-the-vm-series-firewall/software-ngfw/customize-data-plane-cores.html#id4e6cde84-2453-4173-b55c-f4e02c7f0e46).

The following are the memory tiers available in Prisma AIRS NGFW and VM-Series
 firewall:






















 

| Tier 1 | 1-8 GB |
| --- | --- |
| Tier 2 | 9-18 GB |
| Tier 3 | 19-64 GB |
| Tier 4 | 65-128 GB |



 
 HSF P-Nodes need exactly twice the amount of memory listed in
 these tables. HSF S-Nodes require only the listed amount of memory. Outside of sessions,
 objects limitations do not scale with added HSF Nodes.

If you are using Software NGFW credits for licensing, you can choose a memory profile
 that supports your requirements for one or more of the following resources:
