# Maximum Limits Based on Tier and Memory



 



 The following tables provide the maximum number for
a particular object or resource that a single VM-Series firewall
deployment can create, store, manage, or interact with based on
allocated memory or tier. These limits apply to VM-Series firewalls using
licenses funded with Software NGFW credits. 

For memory scaling, increments of memory are grouped into four
tiers that represent the configuration capacity of the VM-Series
firewall. Regardless of the amount of memory you assign to a VM-Series
firewall instance, the tier that amount of memory falls into determines
the limit for non-sessions values, such as security rules, address
objects, security profiles, etc.

The memory profile and the total number of vCPUs determine how
many cores are automatically assigned to the management plane and
the dataplane. Additionally, you have the option to [customize the distribution
of the dataplane cores](/content/techdocs/en_US/vm-series/11-0/vm-series-deployment/license-the-vm-series-firewall/software-ngfw/customize-data-plane-cores.html#id4e6cde84-2453-4173-b55c-f4e02c7f0e46).

If you are using Software NGFW credits for licensing, you can
choose a memory profile that supports your requirements for one
or more of the following resources:
