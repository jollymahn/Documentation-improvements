 After you successfully onboard your firewall to cloud management, you have the option
 to configure and specify the general firewall management settings. Configuring the
 general settings for a firewall isn’t required but is recommended. You can configure
 some or all of the firewall general settings as needed. 

 

1.  Log in to cloud management.
2.  Select 
 ConfigurationNGFW and Prisma AccessDevice SettingsDevice SetupManagementand select the Configuration Scope where you want to configure the
 general settings.
 You can select a folder or firewall from your Folders
 or select Snippets to configure the general settings
 in a snippet. 

 

3.  Click the cog wheel to edit the General Settings and
 Customize.
 
 
 If you modified the General Settings for a nested folder or individual
 device, you can Revert to Inherited to revert the
 General Settings configuration from the
 Customized configuration to that
 inherited from the parent folder of the nester folder or that inherited
 from the folder the firewall is associated with.

 

4.  Enter the network Domain domain name for the firewall
 (up to 31 characters).
5.  Enter text to display in the Login Banner on the
 firewall web interface login page (up to 3,200 characters).
 (Optional) Check (enable) Force Admins to Acknowledge
 Login Banner to force administrators to select I
 Accept and Acknowledge the Statement Below when logging in
 to the firewall web interface. This forces local firewall admins to
 acknowledge the login banner before they can log into the firewall web
 interface.

 

6.  Select or create a SSL/TSL Service Profile to specify a
 certificate and the SSL/TSL protocol settings allowed on the management
 interface.
 The firewall uses this certificate to authenticate to administrators who
 access the web interface through the management (MGT) interface or through
 any other interface that supports HTTP/HTTPS management traffic. If you
 select None, the firewall uses a predefined
 certificate.

 

7.  Select the Time Zone where the firewall is
 located.
8.  Select the Locale where the firewall is located to
 specify the language for PDF reports generated locally on the firewall.
9.  Enter the Latitude (-90.0 to
 90.0) and Longitude (-180.0 to
 180.0) of the firewall.
10.  Check (enable) Automatically Acquire Commit Lock to
 automatically apply a commit lock when you change the candidate
 configuration.
 
 
 Enable this setting so that other administrators can’t make configuration
 changes until the first administrator commits their changes.

 

11.  Check (enable) Certificate Expiration Check to instruct
 the firewall to create a warning message when on-device certificates approach
 their expiration date.
12.  (VM-Series firewall only) Check (enable) Use Hypervisor
 Assigned MAC Addresses to have the VM-Series firewall use the
 MAC address that the hypervisor assigned, instead of generating a MAC address
 using the PAN-OS custom schema.
13.  Check (enable) Tunnel Acceleration to improve
 performance and throughput for traffic going through GRE tunnels, VXLAN tunnels,
 and GTP-U tunnels. This option is enabled by default.
 
 
 If you disable or reenable Tunnel Acceleration and
 commit, you must reboot the firewall.

 

14.  Save.
15.  Push Config to push your configuration changes.
